  ## Introduction
  
  In this tutorial, we'll walk through the process of masking credit card information within a text using regular expressions in JavaScript...
  
  ## Prerequisites
  
  - Basic understanding of JavaScript.
- Basic understanding of regular expressions.
  
  ## Tutorial Steps
  
  1. Identifying Credit Card Numbers
2. JavaScript Code
  
  ### Step 1: Identifying Credit Card Numbers
  
  Credit card numbers follow specific formats, including Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and Discover. We'll focus on masking these formats.
  
  ### Step 2: JavaScript Code
  
  We'll create a JavaScript snippet to match and mask credit card numbers in the given text.
  
  ```javascript
  
const text = "Please use your Visa card 4111-1111-1111-1111 or MasterCard 5555 1234 5678 9012.";

const pattern = /\b(?:4\d{3}[ -]?\d{4}[ -]?\d{4}[ -]?\d{4}|5\d{3}[ -]?\d{4}[ -]?\d{4}[ -]?\d{4}|3[47]\d{2}[ -]?\d{6}[ -]?\d{5}|6\d{3}[ -]?\d{4}[ -]?\d{4}[ -]?\d{4})\b/g;

const maskedText = text.replace(pattern, "****-****-****-****");

console.log(maskedText);
  
  ```
